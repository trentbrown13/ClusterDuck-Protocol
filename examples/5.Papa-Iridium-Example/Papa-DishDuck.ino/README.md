# DishDuck 
When you are in the middle of nowhere or there are no ClusterDuck networks in your area what do you do? 
Well if you need sensor data or a emergency communications mesh network in that area. 

**Then checkout the DishDuck**

The DishDuck is made up of a modfied PAPA Duck with a Irdium Satellite Modem. The Sattelite Modem is called the RockBlock 9603 that allows you to talk to over 75 Iridium Sattelites using Short-Burst Data. With this connection you can almost always send sensor data or even send and receive emergency messages as long as you have a few of the sky.
